I never had the habit of blogging or documenting anything I do or learn. At some point, I started to question if that is a hindrance on my life or my carrer. Memory is fleeting - we forget many parts of our days, our struggles and specially our learning process, as they are often difficult, so our brain prefer to remember those gleefuly moments with friends, family, lovers... or some real bad events, but let's not think on those.

Still, my goal with this blog and some others is not only to help my memory but make myself known. As an old saying in programming, "talk is cheap, show me the code". In this case, I'm here to show not only code but what I've learned, discovered and made. These things, if not documented or readily available, can come across as having someone simply trusting you. And like I was saying, memory sometimes can fail you at an important event, like a job interview (which has happened to me before), even if deep down you know that it's something that you known or at least known how to work around it. For example, programming is a very complex task and I rely heavily on documentation, since I can't remember all the specific syntax and terminology for every language, framework or tool I've worked with.
